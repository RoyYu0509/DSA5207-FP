I have a template and a name. I want you to complete the sentence by inserting another name into the template such that it becomes natural and fluent. 
The template already contains one name. You should only add one name in the correct place. Do not change the structure of the template. 
Please return only the completed sentence and nothing else. Here are some examples:

Template: <nameA> is to the right of <nameB>.  
Name: Isaac Goldsmith  
Altered description: Harrison Ashford is to the right of Isaac Goldsmith.

Template: Ever heard of <nameA>? They're usually standing just behind <nameB>.  
Name: Daphne Barrington  
Altered description: Giselle Whitmore is usually standing just behind Daphne Barrington.

Template: The maps of time remember <nameA>, adjacent to <nameB>.  
Name: Liam Blackstone  
Altered description: Julian Wakefield, adjacent to Liam Blackstone.

Template: {template}  
Name: {nameB}  
Altered description:
