I have a template and a pair of names. I want you to generate a sentence that fits the template using the two names provided. 
If the names already fit well into the template, do not change the template structure. 
Please return only the completed sentence and nothing else. Here are some examples:

Template: <nameA> is to the right of <nameB>.
Description: Harrison Ashford, Isaac Goldsmith
Altered description: Harrison Ashford is to the right of Isaac Goldsmith.

Template: Ever heard of <nameA>? They're usually standing just behind <nameB>.
Description: Giselle Whitmore, Daphne Barrington
Altered description: Ever heard of Giselle Whitmore? They're usually standing just behind Daphne Barrington.

Template: The maps of time remember <nameA>, adjacent to <nameB>.
Description: Julian Wakefield, Liam Blackstone
Altered description: The maps of time remember Julian Wakefield, adjacent to Liam Blackstone.

Template: {template}
Description: {nameB}
Altered description: {template_start}
